The Science Platform instances `lsst-lsp-stable` and `lsst-lsp-int` will be taken down at 09:00 PDT on Tuesday 21 May 2019 for a major reconfiguration of the underlying Kubernetes clusters.
The work is a step toward a more robust environment, more suitable for running production services, and includes measures like the provision of redundant head nodes.
It will also pave the way for future changes such as improved performance for accessing shared filesystems on GPFS, and for removing the requirement to access the `lsst-lsp-stable` instance through a VPN.
The primary work is expected to take up to the full working day, concluding at 17:00 PDT.

Later in the week we will be performing some integration tests on `lsst-lsp-int`, including experimenting with modified security policies and with native GPFS mounts.
Users should anticipate the possibility of the `lsst-lsp-int` LSP instance going up and down a number of times during the week.
