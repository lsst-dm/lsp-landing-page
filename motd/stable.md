The Science Platform instances `lsst-lsp-stable` and `lsst-lsp-int` are currently down for a major reconfiguration of the underlying Kubernetes clusters.  We aim to restore normal operation of `lsst-lsp-stable` as soon as possible, ideally today.  Updates will be posted to #dm-lsp on LSST Slack.

The Science Platform instances `lsst-lsp-stable` and `lsst-lsp-int` will be taken down at 09:00 PDT on Tuesday 21 May 2019 for a major reconfiguration of the underlying Kubernetes clusters.
The work is a step toward a more robust environment, more suitable for running production services, and includes measures like the provision of redundant head nodes.
It will also pave the way for future changes such as improved performance for accessing shared filesystems on GPFS, and for removing the requirement to access the `lsst-lsp-stable` instance through a VPN.
The primary work is expected to take up to the full working day, concluding at 17:00 PDT.

Normal service should resume on `lsst-lsp-stable` at the conclusion of this work.
We expect to take some shorter outages in the coming weeks to roll out additional changes, once they have been adequately tested on `lsst-lsp-int`.
Please let us know right away if you see any unusual behavior.
